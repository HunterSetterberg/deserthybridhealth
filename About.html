    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To empower people to live stronger, longer lives through movement, nutrition, and physician-guided care — no prescriptions required.</p>

    <h3>Built by Family, Backed by Science</h3>
    <p>Desert Hybrid Health was co-founded by a board-certified physician and a certified personal trainer/sports nutrition coach. We’re family — and we’re on a mission to reinvent how healthcare is delivered.</p>
    <p>We saw too many people stuck in reactive, prescription-first systems that ignored the real drivers of performance and longevity. So we decided to build a solution: a virtual clinic that pairs evidence-based medicine with real-world coaching.</p>
