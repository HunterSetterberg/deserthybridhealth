      <h4>Do I need to live in a specific location?</h4>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Do you accept insurance?</h4>
      <p>We do not bill insurance. This allows us to focus fully on personalized, proactive care without the limitations of traditional insurance models. You'll know exactly what you're paying for — no surprise bills.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>What’s the commitment?</h4>
      <p>Our programs are month-to-month, with no long-term contracts. We want you to stay because it’s working — not because you're locked in.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <h4>Is this right for me if I’m not an athlete?</h4>
